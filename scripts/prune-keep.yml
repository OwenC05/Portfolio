# Explicit keep rules for the repo prune tool.
# Add glob patterns under `keep:` to exclude files from deletion.
# Examples:
# - Keep all 3D assets
# - Keep a specific folder under public
# - Keep experimental components

keep:
  - "public/models/**"
  - "public/textures/**"
  - "components/experimental/**"
  - "**/*.stories.*"
  - "**/*.spec.*"
